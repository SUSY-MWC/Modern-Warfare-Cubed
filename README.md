# Modern Warfare Cubed

**Modern Warfare Cubed** is a fork of the popular [Vic's Modern Warfare Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vics-modern-warfare-mod) which is now discontinued aiming to improve and expand upon the experience.

![Features Showcase](https://github.com/Cubed-Development/Modern-Warfare-Cubed/assets/82710983/f7049789-86c8-41a0-8d99-a8ed545f5659)

Modern Warfare Cubed introduces a plethora of new features to Minecraft, including an extensive arsenal of modern weaponry, new explosives, equipment, and more.

It introduces a wide range of modern weapons to Minecraft, including assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, pistols, and more. 
These weapons are modeled after real-life firearms and come complete with authentic sound effects and animations.

## Weapon Customization & Statistics!

Our weaponry is heavily customizable with a highly advanced attachment system made up of 3 main parts; **Customization**, **Modification** and **Attachments**.

Each weapon has its own unique attributes, such as rate of fire, accuracy, and damage.
Some weapons have specialized attachments that can be added, like scopes, suppressors, and more, to further enhance their performance.

Here's a sneak-peak into what it looks like in-game!

## Tablets and Cameras!

A feature that allows you to put cameras on entities and watch what they're doing! But be careful! The cameras have a limited range before they lose functionality and start to glitch out. Throw cameras at mobs, or even other players!

Simply press your Left and Right arrow keys to navigate between cameras!
